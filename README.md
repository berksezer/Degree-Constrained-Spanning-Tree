# Degree-Constrained-Spanning-Tree

This project aims to create algorithms for the Degree Constrained Spanning Tree problem and analyze these algorithms with respect to their costs. 

There will be a randomly generated undirected graph G(V, E) and the problem wants
us to generate a number k which will be equal to the number of the highest degree of that
undirected graph’s spanning tree. The degree of a node is the number of edges that are
connected to that node. We will need to look at every spanning tree’s node and count the
edges which are linked to that node and the highest value will be equal to k. That k will be the
minimum integer which no other node will have a greater degree than it. This problem may
also be seen in optimization problems especially in distance optimization problems in real
life.
